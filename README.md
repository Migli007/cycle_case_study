## Introduction

membership are much more profitable compared to casual riders. Based on their analyzation, the 
company has decided to create marketing strategies in order to influence their users to become 
annual riders. The business task I was given, is to analyze the company’s data in order to 
differentiate casual riders and annual riders. The insights I would give from my business task
